#LOE README!
#
# For some reason Rails saw it fit to chop off the "es" of Loes when building the      
# model/controller.
# Because of this when not referring to the table, Loe becomes Lo.
# Sorry to have screwed it up, but I don't know how to force rails not to 
# mane guesses about how English works.
